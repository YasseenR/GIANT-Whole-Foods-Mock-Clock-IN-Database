# GIANT-Whole-Foods-Mock-Clock-IN-Database
This is a repository of the database that I created that "solved" a problem I personally saw when I worked at GIANT Whole Foods.
I decided to work on this project as a final for my class in college to solve a mock problem that we saw in a company.
I used an SQL Database to rework the clock in system to fix how time was wasted when an employee forgot to clock out of a shift.
The database solved employees wasting their time fixing the problem and instead automates it to be done automatically resulting 
in the company not losing as much money from time being wasted in an employees shift trying to fix a problem that can be automated.
